# 🎯 Short Subscription Form Prompt for Continue

**ISSUE**: Subscription form backend broken. Need help with Railway app "Hospitable-forgiveness".

**CONTEXT**: 
- Website has 3 forms: Contact, Claims, Subscription
- Contact + Claims forms work (use contact-api)
- Subscription form broken (uses Hospitable-forgiveness Railway app)

**DON'T TOUCH**: contact-api, Contact forms, Claims forms (all working)

**FIX NEEDED**: Only the subscription form backend

**TASKS**:
1. Check "Hospitable-forgiveness" Railway deployment status
2. Check logs for errors  
3. Test subscription endpoints
4. Fix any deployment/runtime issues
5. Ensure subscription form submits correctly

**RAILWAY APP**: "Hospitable-forgiveness" (separate from contact-api)

Can you help debug the subscription form backend?
